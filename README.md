# NLS-project-APMA922

This APMA 922 Fall 2021 course project examines both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLS) and is in collaboration with Suki Shergill. We solve on a finite domain subject to periodic boundary conditions. The initial data comes from exact solutions evaluated at time t = 0. We study NLS because the equation can be used to approximate the dynamics of different physical phenomena. The goal is to compare performace of a traditional spectral method with a machine learning approach. We use a psuedo-spectral method which applies both second and sixth order Strang splitting so the linear part can be solved exactly in the Fourier domain and the nonlinear part turns out to also have exact solution which Mathematica can find for us. This is done in 1D and 2D and code can be found in the Python notebook. For the physics informed deep learning approach, we used Maziar Raissi's 1D code   https://github.com/maziarraissi/DeepHPMs/blob/master/Codes/Schrodinger.py using different data files and modified parameters.
